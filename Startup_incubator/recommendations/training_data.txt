The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO, /ˈɪsroʊ/) is the space agency of the Government of India headquartered in the city of Bengaluru. Its vision is to "harness space technology for national development while pursuing space science research and planetary exploration. Formed in 1969, ISRO superseded the erstwhile Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) established in 1962 by the efforts of independent India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and his close aide and scientist Vikram Sarabhai. The establishment of ISRO thus institutionalised space activities in India.[6] It is managed by the Department of Space, which reports to the Prime Minister of India. ISRO built India's first satellite, Aryabhata, which was launched by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1975.[7] It was named after the mathematician Aryabhata. In 1980, Rohini became the first satellite to be placed in orbit by an Indian-made launch vehicle, SLV-3. ISRO subsequently developed two other rockets: the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) for launching satellites into polar orbits and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) for placing satellites into geostationary orbits. These rockets have launched numerous communications satellites and earth observation satellites. Satellite navigation systems like GAGAN and IRNSS have been deployed. In January 2014, ISRO used an indigenous cryogenic engine in a GSLV-D5 launch of the GSAT-14. ISRO sent a lunar orbiter, Chandrayaan-1, on 22 October 2008 and a Mars orbiter, Mars Orbiter Mission, on 5 November 2013, which entered Mars orbit on 24 September 2014, making India the first nation to succeed on its first attempt to Mars, and ISRO the fourth space agency in the world as well as the first space agency in Asia to reach Mars orbit.[10] On 18 June 2016, ISRO set a record with a launch of twenty satellites in a single payload, one being a satellite from Google.[11] On 15 February 2017, ISRO launched one hundred and four satellites in a single rocket (PSLV-C37) and created a world record.[12][13] ISRO launched its heaviest rocket, Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle-Mark III (GSLV-Mk III), on 5 June 2017 and placed a communications satellite GSAT-19 in orbit. With this launch, ISRO became capable of launching 4-ton heavy satellites into GTO. Modern space research in India is most visibly traced to the 1920s, when the scientist S. K. Mitra conducted a series of experiments leading to the sounding of the ionosphere by application of ground-based radio methods in Calcutta.[15] Later, Indian scientists like C.V. Raman and Meghnad Saha contributed to scientific principles applicable in space sciences.[15] However, it was the period after 1945 that saw important developments being made in coordinated space research in India.[15] Organised space research in India was spearheaded by two scientists: Vikram Sarabhai—founder of the Physical Research Laboratory at Ahmedabad—and Homi Bhabha, who established the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in 1945.[15] Initial experiments in space sciences included the study of cosmic radiation, high altitude and airborne testing, deep underground experimentation at the Kolar mines—one of the deepest mining sites in the world—and studies of the upper atmosphere.[16] Studies were carried out at research laboratories, universities, and independent locations

We are a part of the "SHRIRAM" conglomerate which has significant presence in financial services viz., commercial vehicle financing business, consumer finance, life and general insurance, stock broking, chit funds and distribution of financial products such as life and general insurance products and units of mutual funds.  Our Company was incorporated in the year 1979 and is registered as a Deposit taking NBFC with Reserve Bank of India under section 45IA of the Reserve Bank of India Act ,1934.  STFC decided to finance the much neglected Small Truck Owner. Shriram understood the power of 'Aspiration' much before marketing based on 'Aspiration' became fashionable. Shriram started lending to the Small Truck Owner to buy new trucks. But we found a mismatch between the Aspiration and Ability. The Truck Operator was honest but the Equity at his command was not sufficient to support the credit levels required to buy a new truck.  We did not have the heart to send the Truck Operator back empty handed; we decided to fund Pre-owned Trucks. This was the most momentous decision that we made. What followed was Sheer magic. From Driver to Owner, even if only of a Pre-owned Truck and from Pre-owned Truck to the New Truck, we have been with him in his journey of Prosperity as he has been our partner in our road to success and leadership.  For us at Shriram, credit-worthiness of the Small Truck Owner has always been an article of faith. This faith has guided our journey from our pioneering days in financing Small Truck Owners to the present day leadership. Today we are not only the leader in Truck Finance; we are also India's largest Asset Based Non-Banking Finance Company.  The inability of the economists to capture data relating to the economic activity of the informal sector has resulted in its neglect at the policy-making levels in the government.  The distribution of Truck Ownership being scattered among a large number of individuals has resulted in this very important group being missed by the institutional radar.  It is estimated that 80% of trucks in the country are in the hands of individuals.
